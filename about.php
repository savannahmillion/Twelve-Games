					Twelve Games is a set of twelve micro-games released over twelve days preceding Christmas. David and Savannah initiated it as a fun exploration in HTML5 game frameworks and learning git together. The project is hosted <a href="https://github.com/savannahmillion/Twelve-Games">here on GitHub</a> if you'd like to check it out! The games were built with <a href="http://phaser.io/">phaser.io</a>. The audio was made with Logic Pro and <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">bfxr</a>.
